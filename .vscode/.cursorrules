# EchoShell - Voice-Controlled Terminal Management System

## Project Overview
Distributed system for remote terminal management and execution via voice commands from mobile devices (iPhone/Apple Watch), with real-time output streaming and text-to-speech responses.

## Mandatory Rules

### English Only
**CRITICAL**: All code, comments, documentation, commit messages, and communication MUST be in English.

### Conventional Commits
All commits MUST follow the format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

## Technology Stack
- **Server**: TypeScript 5.0+, Node.js 20+, Express/Fastify
- **Client**: Swift 5.9+, SwiftUI (iOS 17+, watchOS 10+)
- **AI**: OpenAI (GPT-4, Whisper, TTS), Anthropic Claude
- **Tools**: Cloudflare Tunnel, LangChain.js, node-pty

## Available Commands

### /review
Review a pull request with detailed feedback including:
1. Code quality assessment
2. Security implications
3. Performance considerations
4. Suggested improvements

### /security-review
Complete security review analyzing:
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Input validation and sanitization
- API key handling and storage
- Potential vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Command injection risks

### /init
Initialize or update CLAUDE.md with codebase documentation including:
- Project structure overview
- Key files and their purposes
- Important patterns and conventions
- Setup instructions

## Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Explicit error handling required
- Security-first approach for all features
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Real-time output streaming for terminal sessions

## Security Considerations
- Master API keys stored only on laptop
- Ephemeral keys for mobile devices (1-hour expiration)
- Rate limiting per device
- TLS/WSS for all communication
- Dangerous command blocking (rm -rf, mkfs, dd)

## Project Context
See CLAUDE.md for full technical specification and implementation details.
